# ðŸŒŸ Irissembly: Iris Classification with AVR Assembly ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to **Irissembly**, where cutting-edge machine learning meets low-level programming! This project showcases a decision tree classifier for iris flower classification, implemented entirely in [AVR Assembly](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/AVR-Instruction-Set-Manual-DS40002198A.pdf).

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- **ðŸ”§ Assembly Language Mastery**: Implemented using AVR Assembly, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in low-level programming.
- **ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification**: Classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- **ðŸŒ² Decision Tree Model**: Uses a decision tree with `max_depth=3` for accurate classification.

## ðŸ“Š Buffer Usage

Efficient buffer management is crucial for this project. Here's how the buffers are utilized:

| 0-7 | 8-15 | 16-23              | 24-31               |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 0   | 0    | 0                  | Petal Length Lower  |
| 0   | 0    | 0                  | Petal Length Higher |
| 0   | 0    | 0                  | Petal Width Lower   |
| 0   | 0    | Comparison Results | Petal Width Higher  |
| 0   | 0    | Comp A Lower       | Sepal Length Lower  |
| 0   | 0    | Comp A Higher      | Sepal Length Higher |
| 0   | 0    | Comp B Lower       |                     |
| 0   | 0    | Comp B Higher      | Final Result        |

The final classification result is stored at memory address `0x00800101`, which can be accessed via gdb using `(gdb) x /1x 0x00800101`.
